Revision history for Perl module Business::ISBN::Data

20210112.006 2021-02-16T04:08:08Z
	* Fix testing bug. This module needs Business::ISBN 3.005 to match 
	the data structures. Prior to that, Business::ISBN had a bug with
	ISBN13.

20210112.005_03 2021-02-15T17:43:08Z
	* I think the CPAN Tester failures are using older versions of
	Business::ISBN (older than 3.005 all seem to fail). I assumed they
	started fresh, but I guess not. Require a recent version in the
	default_data test.

20210112.005_02 2021-02-14T05:07:05Z
	* Try harder to see what's going on in CPAN Testers

20210112.005_01 2021-02-13T12:40:28Z
	* Try harder to figure out these test failures

20210112.005 2021-02-13T05:23:58Z
	* Fix the default data test. It should only run when you have 
	Business::ISBN already, and it shouldn't do stupid things like
	using an array that I didn't put anything in.

20210112.004 2021-02-10T04:29:32Z
	* Test the default data.
	* Add a note about packaging RangeMessage.xml (adapted from gwyn17)

20210112.003 2021-02-09T22:42:53Z
	* The default data had a problem because I used the same hash key
	twice in the default data (Github #7). Found by gwyn17.

20210112.002 2021-02-07T05:46:20Z
	* Don't try to load a data file if there are no data files
	(Github #6)

20210112.001 2021-01-19T14:48:12Z

	* Hide the Business::ISBN namespace

20140910.02 - 2014-09-22
	* Look in the current directory for RangeMessage.xml if it's
	not in other locations. This can help with various Perl app
	packagers. (But, also try ISBN_RANGE_MESSAGE env var)
